            <h2>Sandra Angers-Blondin</h2>
          <p>I have recently completed my PhD at the University of Edinburgh, studying the growth responses of tundra plants to climate change. I love to share my passion for nature and science, be it through outreach, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sandra.angers.b/" target="_blank">photography</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SandyAngersB" target="_blank">social media</a>, or teaching. I’ve been a tutor for the Coding Club for over two years, and I love that I get to learn new things every week by helping other participants solve their coding challenges! I am now working on developing our brand new online course set to launch in 2020 (stay tuned…). </p>

            <h2>John Godlee</h2>
          <p>I am a PhD student from the University of Edinburgh where I research the canopy structure of savanna ecosystems and its relationship with biodiversity. I have used R on a range of projects, from analysing employee satisfaction data for a private equity firm to mining linguistic transcripts for speech patterns. Through my own work, I have gained experience in using R for statistical modelling, mapping, and data manipulation. I have experience designing sustainable projects through my work in nature conservation and as the student representative for the University of Edinburgh School of GeoSciences. I’m very interested in the role of open-source and collaborative technology in academia. I am part of the <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 Doctoral Training Programme.</a></p>

            <h2>Izzy Rich</h2>
          <p>I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying Ecological and Environmental Sciences. My main interests involve using data and statistics to understand and help create a more renewable and sustainable energy sector. Currently, I am working on my undergraduate dissertation, which looks at the extent to which socio-economic events can be linked to land-use change through satellite data. I started coming to Coding Club in 2017 and the journey since then has provided me with an insurmountable love for data that I can’t help but share! I hope that I can use my journey to inspire others and help conquer their coding anxieties, too!</p>

          <p>I’m a final year Ecological and Environmental Sciences with management undergraduate student, and interested in the use of technology such as unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs) in conservation, environmental and ecological sciences. I also have a passion for learning about new programs and software: I was first introduced to R in Year 2, started regularly attending Coding Club in 2017, and have familiarity with other programs such as ArcGIS and Pix4Dmapper. The Coding Club team, and the friendly and accepting environment has played a key role in inspiring me to boldly take on these ventures I never thought possible, and I am happy to join the team and hopefully inspire my peers to do the same. </p>

          <p>I’m a third year <a href="http://e3dtp.geos.ed.ac.uk/" target="_blank">NERC E3 DTP</a> PhD student investigating the causes and consequences of vegetation change in the tundra biome. My research requires a range of coding tools and software, from using GitHub repositories to hierarchical Bayesian modelling (which I still haven’t quite grasped yet!). I had never even used R before starting my PhD, so a course like this earlier on in my research career would have been immensely valuable: this is a great opportunity to pass on the skills I have learnt onto others. I have a large amount of teaching experience, both as a tutor for Masters and Undergraduate course and as a demonstrator in previous statistics classes, and have been previously nominated for a teaching award.</p>

Through my project, I gained experience in handling large quantities of data in R, as well as in using different R packages and clustering methods. I began to consistently use this software in my research when I started my PhD and, because of this, I see how valuable an initiative such as Coding Club is for students and young researchers who want/need to acquire coding and data management skills in R.  </p>

          <p>I’m an evolutionary behavioural ecologist, with a particular interest in reproductive and social behaviours. I’m currently doing my PhD at the University of Edinburgh working on the superb fairy-wren (Malurus cyaneus). The main focus of my project is to explore the dynamics of inbreeding and infidelity, investigating context-dependent mate choice and the effects of the social environment in this cooperative breeder. Most of my time is spent working with a long-term dataset and modeling in R, however I also carry out fieldwork investigating the interactions between fairy-wren mothers and their sons in Australia.

          <p>I am an ecologist interested in the effects of environmental change on marine ecosystems. For my PhD I am studying breeding phenology in seabirds, and the way in which they respond to changing conditions. I am researching the patterns, drivers and mechanisms of breeding phenology in a range of seabird species with diverse life history traits. I’m particularly interested in phenological trends on a global scale, and looking for patterns across phylogenetic groups or regions that might help us predict how species respond to environmental change.

I am also interested in how to best design nature conservation in the future. As a nature conservation manager of a protected area in Belgium, I also have practical experience in protecting the regional biodiversity. I really love statistics and I try to learn as much as possible (so much to learn!). By teaching and developing tutorials, I want to pass on this fascination to other people.

          <p>I'm in my 4th (and last!) year of my undergraduate degree in Ecological and Environmental Sciences. My interests lie in sustainable development and peaceful coexistence with nature i.e. permaculture and my passion is definitely wildlife conservation! My dissertation will focus on biodiversity changes and ecosystem interactions across altitudes, with access to data from cloud forests in Peru and alpine tundra in Canada. For this, I will of course, be using R. I was introduced to R two years ago and since then have become fascinated by with what computers can produce with a simple script of code. It has been a love-hate relationship (but mostly love) and I want to show as many people as possible that coding is not as abstract or inaccessible as it looks!</p>

          <p>I am currently in my fourth year studying Ecological and Environmental Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. Having proficient coding skills promises to become of more importance as I enter my final year. In particular, to aid with independent research projects such as my dissertation. Being a class representative for my degree programme has given me the opportunity to talk to peers about potential ways to increase student support in this area. Joining a research expedition this summer lead by Dr Isla Myers-Smith has taught me valuable techniques such as technical expertise, data analysis and ethics in the field, while enabling me to work with a team of scientist who are experts in their field.</p>

            <h2>Joe Boyle</h2>
          <p>I’m a fourth-year ecology student looking for ways to improve my R skills without having to read books about it alone in a darkened room. I've been a member of Team Shrub since November 2014, including the 2015 field season, from which I gained direct experience in scientific practice, including some coding. I’ve been trying to practice R whenever I can, but it’s difficult to know what’s possible of myself and the software without some outside help. Considering how important R is for modern ecology, this course should give me some of the skills I need to improve both my final year’s work and anything beyond.</p>
