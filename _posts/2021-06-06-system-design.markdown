For the last two months, I have been part of the interview processes for some of the early stage startups as well as some MNCs. As a part of preparation for these interviews, along with DSA, I also focused on System Design ( Being 2 years experienced candidate, interviewers expected you to be good in design discussions). So I did some research, went through the blogs, videos, Leetcode discuss sections and curated some handwritten notes which explains the basics of system design from Caching to Web Sockets and Long Polling protocols.

Thought of sharing the PDF of notes with you all. I hope you find these notes helpful. Do let me know if you have any suggestions/ corrections.
